# Introduction

## What is enterprise architecture? ##


Enterprise architecture is a strategic framework that aligns an organization's business strategy, processes, information, and technology to achieve its goals. It provides a holistic view of the organization, enabling effective decision-making, optimization of resources, and adaptation to changes in the business environment.

It is a combination of multiple underlying disciplines, such as:

* Business architecture
* IT architecture
* Technology architecture
* Security architecture

## In simple Terms - EA: ##

Enterprise architecture serves as the blueprint for large organizations, illustrating the cohesive integration of various components such as individuals, tasks, tools, and information. Its purpose is to facilitate the seamless operation of the organization, enabling it to effectively reach its objectives. Comparable to a guiding map, enterprise architecture directs all members within the organization, providing clarity on tasks, interconnections, and the overall path to success
