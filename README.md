Enterprise Architecture Explained here

The term **"enterprise"** encompasses any organization utilizing software systems, extending beyond companies to include government institutions, nonprofit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and charities.

**Enterprise Architecture** (EA) constitutes both a practice and a skill set employed to synchronize technology strategy with business strategies. Furthermore, EA addresses intricate relationships among an enterprise/organization, its personnel, the business processes it facilitates, and the systems automating these processes.
